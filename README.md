NFL DFS modeling, lineup optimization, and lineup creation library

This library is designed to help in the creation of optimal NFL lineups for Daily Fantasy Sports. The overall strategy here is to build x amount of lineups with variety to increase your chances of hitting the big one, while at the same time minimizing your risk and expected loss. With the help of advanced machine learning modelling techniques and other outside sources (e.g. vegas odds, weather, and injury designations) this library can be your one-stop shop at streamlining the creation of infinite (there is an eventually cap here) of unique lineups for any given DFS contest.

Note (1): Current version of the nfl_dfs library is developed strictly for Fanduel contests. Draftkings will be handled in future versions.
